;; SMOOTH SUDOKU game by Ellen Lloyd
;;
;; Based on:
;; Constrained Search Tree Sudoku Solver solution design
;; by Ellen Lloyd
;;
;; In Sudoku, the board is a 9x9 grid of SQUARES.
;; There are 9 ROWS and 9 COLUMNS, there are also 9
;; 3x3 BOXES.  Rows, columns and boxes are all UNITs.
;; So there are 27 units.
;;
;; The idea of the game is to fill each square with
;; a Natural[1, 9] such that no unit contains a duplicate
;; number.
;;

;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@htdd Val)
;; Val is Natural[1, 9]

(@htdd Board)
;; Board is (listof Val|false)   that is 81 elements long
;; interp.
;;  Visually a board is a 9x9 array of squares, where each square
;;  has a row and column number (r, c).  But we represent it as a
;;  single flat list, in which the rows are layed out one after
;;  another in a linear fashion. (See interp. of Pos below for how
;;  we convert back and forth between (r, c) and position in a board.)

(@htdd Pos)
;; Pos is Natural[0, 80]
;; interp.
;;  the position of a square on the board, for a given p, then
;;    - the row    is (quotient p 9)
;;    - the column is (remainder p 9)

;; Convert 0-based row and column to Pos
(define (r-c->pos r c) (+ (* r 9) c))  ;helpful for writing tests

(@htdd Unit)
;; Unit is (listof Pos) of length 9
;; interp. 
;;  The position of every square in a unit. There are
;;  27 of these for the 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 boxes.

;; -----------------
;; NEW Data definitions:

(@htdd Square)
;; Square is one of: Val or (listof Val)
;; If Val, represents a square with a filled-in number on the board
;; If (listof Val), represents possible Val that could be placed in this square
(define S1 3)
(define S2 (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))  ;all placements possible
(define S3 empty)  ;no valid placements
(define S4 (list 2 5 6 9))  ;4 possible placements

(@htdd SmartBoard)
;; SmartBoard is (listof Square) that is 81 elements long.
;; Interp. SmartBoard is just like Board but with extra information stored:
;; each unfilled "false" square is instead represented as a (listof Val) Square
;; that stores possible Vals. Squares in a SmartBoard can be accessed via Pos.
